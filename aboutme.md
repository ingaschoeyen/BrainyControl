title: About The Project
subtitle: Towards Improved Modelling of Motor Control
---

This project was conceived as part of an internship project at the [CCN Maastricht](https://www.ccnmaastricht.com/) and aims to 

- summarize current knowledge about the Sensorimotor Nervous System, its organization and resulting function in motor control
- summarize previous attempts at modelling components of or the entirety of the SMNS
- comprise the above in a closed-loop description of motor control
